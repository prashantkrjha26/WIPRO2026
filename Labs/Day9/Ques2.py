# Question 2 – Unit Testing & Test Driven Development (TDD)

# Topics Covered:
# Unit testing, Test Driven Development

# Implement Test Driven Development (TDD) for a simple calculator module.
# Requirements:
# 1. Write unit test cases first for operations:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division

# 2. Use a Python unit testing framework (unittest or pytest)

# 3. Implement the calculator functions to make the tests pass

# 4. Demonstrate handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero)

# 5. Explain the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
