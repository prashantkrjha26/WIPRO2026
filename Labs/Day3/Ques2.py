# Question – Functions, Modules, File Handling & Exceptions

# Topic: Functions, Modules (package), File Handling, Exceptions

# Create a small Python package with:
# 1. A module containing a function write_numbers_to_file(filename)
# 2. The function should write numbers 1–100 into a file
# 3. Handle possible exceptions such as:
# File not found
# Permission denied
# 4. Create another module that imports this function
# and reads the file content safely


# writer module
def write_numbers_to_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "w") as file:
            for i in range(1, 101):
                file.write(f"{i}\n")
        print("Numbers written successfully")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: File path not found")

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: Permission denied while writing the file")


# reader module
def read_file_safely(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
            print("File content:\n")
            print(content)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: File not found")

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: Permission denied while reading the file")


# main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_name = "numbers.txt"
    write_numbers_to_file(file_name)
    read_file_safely(file_name)
